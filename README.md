# Treehouse Techdegree - Project 8 - Employee Directory

Main focus for this project was Asynchronous Programming and communicating with an API.

Task was to create an employee directory using the randomuser API (https://randomuser.me/).  Fetch was used to request a JSON object with specified filters to capture certain pieces of data for 12 random employees.  Once the data is returned, it was then parsed so that each employee photo, name, email and location would show to the screen.

Highlights of the features for this project:
- Each employee is clickable which would enable a modal to appear with further details about that employee 
- When the modal is activated user can also move back and forth between employee details  
- Employee search feature implemented
- Toggle to switch between light and dark themes added.  Local storage used to allow settings to persist at page reload
- Project is fully responsive, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing
